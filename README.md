# hey, i'm Jorshua :)

i'm a begginer in the world of computers. we've got so used to having them,
to have millions of little circuits in our hands that somehow give us a world
to see through a screen, it is a pity the bad we can make from something so 
wonderful. i just discovered some charm in the way a computer works. there's 
a lot of complexity behind what we've made of our own and yet i was so little
curious about. the mathematics, the bright minds behind them, overall the 
enthusiasm of people doing great things with computers, i've really enjoyed 
going into this world.

i study computer science at the National Autonomus Univertity of Mexico, UNAM.
i enjoy challenging myself to try new things, i'd like to absorb as much as i
can and build great projcts.
