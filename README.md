# hey, i'm Jorshua :)

i'm a begginer in the world of computers. we've got so used to having them,
to have millions of little circuits in our hands that somehow give us a world
to see through a screen. i just discovered some charm in the way a computer
works. there's a lot of complexity behind what we've made of our own. the
mathematics, the bright minds behind them, overall the enthusiasm of people
doing great things with computers, i've really enjoyed going into this world.

i study computer science at the National Autonomus Univertity of Mexico, UNAM.

## currently

i'm learning haskell, rust and c. haskell is somthing i'm very excited about.
